//
1. Computer chooses a random alphabet (a - z).

2. User chooses any letter on keyboard.

3. We determine if the user wins or not.

   * If user picks correct letter than that of computer picked up then user wins and number of wins increases by 1 and the number of counts remaining goes down by 1.

   * If user picks incorrect letter than that of computer picked up then user looses and the number of losses then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

   * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

4. We then add to their score.

   * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
    
   * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
    
   * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

5. The user then presses r, p, or s to play again.
